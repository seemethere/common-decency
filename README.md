# Common Decency

> (A set of rules for residents by residents)

[Common](https://common.com) is a great place to live but the rules for every house are different and
not known by new residents coming in. This repository is to make it clear what the rules
are for every specific house and for members to vote for and support new rules if new
situations may arise.

These rules have organically developed over time by residents for residents and serve to make living a co-living space and enjoyable experience by all.

These rules are by no means exhaustive but do highlight key points that residents have found to be help when living in a co-living space.
